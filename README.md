Machine learning practice showcase.

## Contents

- `concrete-network`: A simple neural network in Keras to predict concrete strength.
  Final project from *Introduction to Deep Learning* course.
- `RAG-chatbot`: A simple chatbot app using Gradio to create a web interface and
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain, in order to answer a prompt
  based on information in a user-provided PDF document. The code relies on IBM's
  watsonx products and must be amended with a proper API configuration in order to
  run outside IBM's Skills Network Labs.
- `RAG-tasks`: Part of the final project with RAG and LangChain, includes text
  splitting, embedding, vector storage, and similarity search using retrievers.
